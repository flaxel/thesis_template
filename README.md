This is an easy template for any thesis.

## Getting Started

You can click on the "[Use this template](https://github.com/flaxel/thesis_template/generate)" button to create a new repository with this template. After that you have a repository with the following structure:

* 00_definitions: all configuration files
* 01_metadata: all extra files
* 02_introduction: opening words
* 03_content: main part of the thesis
* 04_finishing: summary and result of the thesis
* 05_resources: all resources like images, ...

At the end you must only change the variables in the [00_definitions/variables.tex](./00_definitions/variables.tex) file.
